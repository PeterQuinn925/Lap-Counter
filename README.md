# Lap-Counter

This project is a device to count laps when swimming. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the swimmer and counts 50 yds/meters (out and back of a short course standard swimming pool. It calls out the distance on a speaker. Future version may display the distance or possibly transmit them to a smart watch.
